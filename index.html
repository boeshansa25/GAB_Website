        <h2>About LexFest</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the inaugural LexFest, the first of its kind music festival brought to you by the General Activities Board (GAB) of Washington and Lee University! Taking place on Saturday, May 3rd, 2024, at the historic Lime Kiln Theater in picturesque Lexington, Virginia, LexFest marks the beginning of an exciting new tradition.

            At LexFest, we believe in the transformative power of music to unite communities, inspire creativity, and forge lasting connections. This year, as we kick off our journey, we're thrilled to present an exceptional lineup featuring the soulful sounds of 49 Winchester, the rock juggernaut Futurebirds, and the dynamic Boy Named Banjo. Prepare to be swept away by their melodies and immerse yourself in the magic of live music under the stars.
            
            But LexFest isn't just about the music—it's about celebrating our community, our passions, and the joy of coming together in shared experiences. As you sway to the rhythms and savor the flavors from our selection of food trucks, you'll be part of a vibrant tapestry of memories that define the spirit of LexFest.
            
            Join us at LexFest for a day of celebration, discovery, and pure enjoyment. Whether you're a seasoned music aficionado, a culinary enthusiast, or simply seeking an unforgettable experience, LexFest welcomes you to be a part of history at our inaugural event. Let's create memories together at LexFest 2024!</p>
